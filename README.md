##Description
"Dangerous Chef Pioneer" is a psychological top down shooter game.

There are two players. Each one takes turns controlling their character for 3 seconds into the future of the game (with the one not taking his/her turn looking away). Then, the two turns are combined, and the result is shown on the screen to both players in real time. The game then repeats until one player destroys the other.

Controls:
Press the button at the bottom to move through the game.
To control characters (turn by turn), use WASD to move and the mouse to shoot.

NOTE:
Player 1 is RED
Player 2 is ORANGE

##The Theme
This relates to the theme of the competition in that the rate of /change/ is controlled, and that changes are repeatedly parted, rolled back, repeated, and then added up together.
