## [DungeonFall](http://team-mango.com/stuff/1gam/dfall)
By Gareth Williams [@garethiw](http://twitter.com/garethiw)

A dungeon crawler where you make the dungeon out of falling blocks. Help your AI-controlled hero navigate the ever-changing dungeon by placing chests, potions and weapon racks and providing as large an area to explore as possible. Decide whether or not it's a good time to give your hero a mob to kill, or if you should place it out of the way for later! Deal with four different mob types each with their own AI behaviour.

## How to play

Cursors up/down - move piece
Cursors left/right - rotate piece
Z - fast drop
X - instant drop

Build up the dungeon with the falling blocks. The hero explores and fights under its own steam, and gains XP by exploring and killing mobs. More room to explore = more XP.

Impassable areas of dungeon will be filled in with wall tiles automatically - always have a connected path of floor tiles to keep your dungeon growing!

## Blahblah

This is my eleventh game of the year for my [One Game a Month 2013](http://onegameamonth.com/garethiw) attempt. I didn't begin work on it until late in the month due to preparing for an XNA/Monogame development workshop that I taught. I'd have like to have had a better pass at art, and added some sound effects, animations and particles. But alas, time's up!

Thanks for playing!
