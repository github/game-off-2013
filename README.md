## The Challenge

You have the entire month of November to create a **web-based** game *loosely* based on the theme "change".

What do we mean by **loosely** based on "change"? We literally mean, *loosely* based. Some examples might be a FPS where you throw the [loose change](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/loose%20change) in your pockets at the enemy or perhaps a puzzle game where you have to [change](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/change) form to overcome obstacles.

Your game. Your rules. You can participate either as an individual or as a team. You're encouraged to use open source libraries, frameworks, graphics, and sounds in your game.

## The Prizes

We're giving away shiny new [iPad Airs](http://www.apple.com/ipad-air/) (16GB models) to our 5 lucky winners. Runners-up will receive a $100 credit for the [GitHub Shop](http://shop.github.com/), where they can grab some of our :octocat: shirts, hoodies, stickers, and more!

All winners and runners-up will be showcased on our blog.
