"Duck Story":
["Dad: So I was in the office last week, typing up the TPS reports that need to be turned in every Friday, when I heard a quacking sound.",
"Dad: I thought it was Larry again. He has one of those old Blackintosh computers at his desk, you know, the ones with the smiley winking face.",
"Brother: Dad, that's such old technology. When is your company going to upgrade to SuckBox 87?",
"Dad: I know, but let me finish my story. Well, you know how when you click or an alert box comes up the computer can be set to a quacking sound?",
"Dad: So I tell Larry, what's up with all his alert boxes.",
"Mom: Who's Larry again hun?",
"Dad: He's my stall partner. We share he cubicle remember? So he turns around in his office chair, and asks 'what?'",
"Dad: 'The quacking, what's with all the quacking?'",
"Dad: 'I'm not doing it', he tells me.",
"Dad: 'Well, It isn't me.'",
"Dad: Just then the quacking noise happened again.",
"Dad: 'Did you hear that Larry?'",
"Dad: 'Yeah.'",
"Dad: We poked our head above the cubicle to look out and didn't see anybody else in the room. Yet the quacking came again.",
"Dad: Besides the quacking, the room had fallen very silent.",
"Mom: So, what did ya do?",
"Dad: I droop down on my hands and knees, and that's when it got me.",
"Mom: Mercy!",
"Brother: You got attacked by a duck?",
"Dad: That duck ran into me, face first. In its flight to escape, it pooped on my hands. Lucky me.",
"Dad: Larry and I grabbed a few guys on break and we corralled the duck out of the office.",
"Dad: Some of the guys wanted to keep it as a pet, but these are the same guys who don't get much done anyways. No help to office productivity.",
"Grandma: Son, You let a good meal go to waste.",
"Dad: Mom, we don't eat ducks we find on the street. That's just cruel.",
"Grandma: That doesn't stop those Chinese from eating street cats and dogs. Why do you think there are all those missing pet posters in the neighborhood?",
"Mom: Oh good lord!",
"Dad: Mom, you should stop spreading those rumors. It is cars and wild animals.",
"Grandma: Oh I'm sure those are SOME of the reasons. But lying to yourself isn't good honey.",
"Cat: Meow.",

"Creeper Worker":
["Brother: ...and so this guy kept trying to see what I wrote down on my notepad, and I keep trying to hide it from his prying eyes. Anyways...",
"Dad: Hey that reminds me of this guy at work.",
"Brother: I'm trying to tell a story here Dad.",
"Mom: Let Greg finish.",
"Dad: Ok, finish your story.",
"Brother: Well... I forgot where I was going with it. Err, the guy was trying to view my notepad...and well, that's about it. Look what you did Dad.",
"Dad: Sorry. But hey! Now you can hear my story.",
"Dad: Just like you, we had a nosey co-worker. This co-worker was showing around a new customer to our branch when a screensaver caught his in a nearby room.",
"Grandma: What is a screensaver?",
"Dad: You know on a computer when you don't use it and the screen goes black? It is like that, except this computer has an animated display like a slide show.",
"Grandma: Ok, a slide show on the computer.",
"Dad: Yes, sort of like that.",
"Dad: Well, the co-worker enters the room, with the new customer, to check out the screen saver. Now this room belongs to Julia, our PR rep.",
"Dad: I'm not sure why he entered the room. He could have just viewed the screen saver through the office window.",
"Dad: Julia wasn't there at the time, but word gets around quickly in the office.",
"Dad: She found out that Rob, that's the co-worker, entered the room, and filed a complaint with Internal Relations.",
"Dad: Then Internal relations sends a message to Rob, asking if he did enter the room.",
"Dad: And then Rob sends a long email response back, all the while with our customer in tow, even asking the customer advice about what to include in the E-mail.",
"Brother: Wow, so did you lose the customer?",
"Dad: We don't know yet, but management did send an internal memo around re-affirming the boundaries of privacy.",
"Dad: This whole thing was completely overblown though. Rob was just looking at a screensaver. He didn't even try and hide it either.",
"Dad: But that's life. People who get excited over nothing.",
"Wife: Well, he did seem kind of creepy asking for the customer's advice on the E-mail.",
"Brother: And what about Julia? She seemed to know a littttle bit too much about the goings on in her office cubicle.",
"Dad: Maybe she has an office camera or something. I'm not sure.",
"Brother: Do you have one?",
"Dad: No, but then again I'm not in PR. Sometimes workers try and find out what the dirt is on them, or try and change their records on the computer.",
"Brother: Sorry to say, it honestly sounds like a terrible place to work.",
"Dad: It isn't as bad as it seems. Every now and then sometime like this happens and it becomes the talk of the town.",
"Brother: Maybe just a boring place."],

"Paint Bucket Sucks":
["Brother: Hey Grandpa, I've got a funny story about that primer you gave me.",
"Grandpa: You'll have to remind me again, my memory isn't too good in my old age.",
"Brother: Well, you gave me some primer to redo my room.",
"Mom: How is the painting going? Last I heard you had the priming done.",
"Brother: Yup. Well, almost. I still have a mess to clean up.",
"Mom: What happened?",
"Brother: Yeaahh well, grandpa's can of primer was pretty old. And it rusted on the bottom and developed small holes.",
"Brother: So, there I was prepping everything, ready to go to town on the walls, when I start feeling some wetness on my pants.",
"Brother: I look down and there are primer drops all over my pants.",
"Dad: Why were you holding the paint bucket though? Don't you just pour it in a roller pan and do it that way like I taught you?",
"Brother: Well yes, but I was also cutting the edges of the room before hand, like you taught me. And that was easier with the paint bucket in my hand.",
"Brother: Or so I thought...",
"Mom: What happened next Greggy?",
"Brother: Mom, don't call me 'Greggy'.",
"Brother: Anywaaays, I quickly put the can down in the roller pan I had nearby. I turned around to find some paper towels to clean myself off with.",
"Brother: That's when I noticed a drip line all the way from the garage. That's not good.",
"Brother: I dashed for the towels and once I reached them, I tried to soak up as much as possible. And well... not good.",
"Brother: In the future, I probably won't go for your primer Grandpa.",
"Grandpa: You know what'll get that paint out? Some turpentine. If you don't have some of that handy you should try out some kerosene.",
"Brother: I tried some paint remover already, but it also took out the color in my pants. Luckily, I wasn't wearing my best pants.",
"Brother: I did have to go for a heavy duty carpet cleaning service. My wife wasn't too happy about that",
"Grandpa: You should have asked me for help. I would have shown you how to do it, and I would have done it for free too.",
"Brother: Thanks Grandpa, I'll definitely keep that in mind."],

"Spouse: errr.. Grandpa?",
"Grandma: Don't mind him. He's losing his mind.",
"Grandpa: I keep it right here. *Taps head* But where did you put the lock on that mouse of yours?",
"Dad: Dad, Mom, don't keep interrupting the story.",
"Grandpa: Well, she started it.",
"Grandma: Ahh, you old coot.",
"Mom: Please continue.",
"Spouse: ummmmm",
"Spouse: Ah, now I remember. [Player] and I were at the mall when a woman came up to us.",
"Spouse: 'Hey guys, sorry to bother you. I'm the host of a free movie screening preview, and we are trying to fill as many seats as possible.'",
"Spouse: 'We severely underestimated the number of people who were going to show up. If you have time, it would really help me out if you two would attend.'",
"Spouse: [Player] thought going to see the free movie was a no brainer, but I knew that we had somewhere to be in less than two hours.",
"Spouse: 'How long is the movie', I asked. She replied, 'About an hour and a half'. Which is about standard.",
"Grandpa: Back in my day...",
"Spouse: 'WE CAN ALWAYS leave early', [Player] whispered to me.",
"Dad: Did you end up seeing it?",
"Spouse: Actually, yes.",
"Spouse: We lined up at the theater, and noticed that all the others in line had a pamphlet ticket. We might be in the wrong line!",
"Spouse: The women told us to mention her name 'Stephanine' at the door to get in, but what if we go up to the doorman, mention 'Stephanine',  and they respond ' Stephanine, who is Stephaine?' ",
"Spouse: The line begins to move, and we approach to the ticket-taker.",
"Spouse: 'Stephanie told us to come'. After a heart wrenching pause, the doorman nodded, and we were allowed in.",
"Dad: What movie was it?",
"Spouse: Stephanie mentioned it was going to be an action documentary about Poland but when we got our seats, the pre-ads were all childish.",
"Spouse: Legos, Toys, cartoons, etc. [Player] and I wondered if the movie we were about to see wasn't even what they told us.",
"Brother: Legos aren't just for kids.",
"Spouse: Maybe not, but the marketing is primarily kid focused. Anyhow, the movie turned out to be the Poland one.",
"Spouse: However, the movie was two hours rather than the expected one hour thirty.",
"Mom: Did you stay the whole time? I could not see myself walking out. I would feel too embarrassed about the whole audience staring at me.",
"Spouse: It isn't that hard, you just treat it like you are headed to the bathroom. Except you never come back.",
"Spouse: But yes, we did leave early, so we'll have to check the rest of the movie on DVD, or see it in theatres when it officially releases.",
"Mom: Good thing the staff didn't send a search party for you. Maybe you fell into the toilet",
"Spouse: Haha",
"Dad: Say, what was the title of the movie?",
"Spouse: 'Randy Staples Shares the Pain.' We saw all the build up, but missed the payoff.",
"Grandpa: Back in my day, we used to watch movies for a nickel.",
"Mom: I remember when gas used to be twenty cents a gallon.",
"Brother: And I remember when the PS3 cost $599 US dollars.",

"Youtube Sensation":
["Grandpa: Back in my day, we burned rats for fun.",
"Brother: Ok Grandpa. Anyways, I was at Frankfort mall the other day.",
"Brother: Just walking around, not really focused on any particular purchase when I noticed a long line. Naturally, you see the line, and wonder what's for.",
"Brother: So, my buddies and I walked up the line to find out the sitch.",
"Mom: What's a 'sitch'.",
"Brother: It means situation.",
"Mom: I see. How long was the line?",
"Brother: Oh, it stretched, maybe, half the mall. There were security guards out, to make sure that traffic could get through gaps in the line.",
"Brother: As we neared the front, we saw that the line moved into some kind of makeup store.",
"Brother: The flier outside said they had one of those video sensations, you know the one who does the makeup? I can't remember her name.",
"Mom: So did you go in?",
"Brother: And wait in that long line? I don't even wear makeup!",
"Mom: Yeah, but what about your fiancee'? Why not get her something nice?",
"Brother: I'm sure she would love some makeup, but I can buy that stuff on any day.",
"Brother: One kind of interesting, but obvious, thing about the line composition was that it was majorly women. There was a handful of guys, but I'd assume they were boyfriends.",
"Grandpa: Back in my day, I would have gotten in that line and wooed all the women.",
"Grandma: You can't even grab the attention of a taxi.",
"Grandpa: You're not making sense. Why would I want to take a taxi out to dinner?",
"Grandma: No, not taking a taxi out to dinner. Forget it. Just forget it."],

"Girlfriend's Boba Keeps on a-flowing":
["Spouse: You know what boba is right Mom?",
"Mom: What's Boba?",
"Spouse: Ok, I guess not.",
"Grandma: What's booba?",
"Spouse: I take it you mean boba?",
"Grandma: Yes, that thing.",
"Spouse: What most people talk about when they mean 'boba' are tea drinks with milk in them.",
"Spouse: The boba tea drinks are not hard to make, just make black tea, and then add any kind of milk you have, some sweetener, then chill with ice.",
"Spouse: [Player] and I made it at home one time, but that's another story. Anyways, the 'boba' itself are these little black balls that are made out of sweet potato.",
"Dad: Sweet Potatoes, like a yam?",
"Brother: Dad, you know that sweet potatoes and yams are not the same right?",
"Dad: What? They aren't?",
"Brother: No",
"Dad: Well, what's the difference?",
"Brother: I don't know, but the point is they are different.",
"Spouse: Boba is usually made from sweet potatoes, but it can also be made from other starchy materials, I suppose.",
"Dad: What's it taste like? Kind of...potatoey?",
"Spouse: Not really, it is chewy, a bit like... when you take the first bite into some gum. Right before it gets soft.",
"Spouse: Though when places heat it up, it is really soft and moldable.",
"Grandma: Hmm. I wouldn't mind trying this boba sometime.",
"Spouse: You definitely should since I know you like your morning tea.",
"Spouse: Now that you all know what boba is, I can tell you about this cool, and somewhat awkward event that happened.",
"Spouse: [Player] and I were driving down the freeway when we remembered that a new boba place was opening up on Teller St.",
"Spouse: As part of their opening promotion, they were offering one free boba drink per customer.",
"Spouse: Since I was thirsty, I suggested we drop by and see what's up.",
"Spouse: We parked and walk up to the building. There weren't too many people about, and a sign revealed why.",
"Spouse: The free boba promotion ended at 8PM, and it was already 10!",
"Mom: Aww, that's too bad",
"Spouse: I decided to get a drink anyways.",
"Spouse: But when I ordered, the worker said 'Would you like to try one of our free drinks?', and motioned towards the sign",
"Spouse: 'Sure!', Then he asked [Player] what [GenderPronoun] wanted.",
"Spouse: So we both got a full-sized free drink!",
"Mom: What flavor did you get? I assume there are flavors of boba?",
"Spouse: Yes, there are. I ordered Strawberry. It tasted ok, but was really missing that strawberry flavor.",
"Spouse: The worker asked how they were, and well Mom, you raised me to be an honest individual, so it was lacking in flavor.",
"Spouse: So the worker says, 'Alright, let me make you another one'",
"Spouse: He makes me a completely new boba drink, while letting me keep the old one to drink. At this point I haven't even paid for anything yet",
"Dad: That's just good customer service. Since this place is new, he is trying to build up customer relations.",
"Spouse: True, but I feel like it got a little out of hand. The next drink also lacked the strawberry flavor. The worker said it is probably because of the syrup.",
"Spouse: He then proceeded to make another drink, still free, using fresh strawberries in lieu of the syrup flavoring.",
"Spouse: Now the syrup drinks were probably really cheap to make, but making drinks with real fruit costs considerably more.",
"Spouse: By the end of our time at the place, the two of us had six drinks in hand without a cent spent.",
"Spouse: The worker just kept offering us samples and I felt really guilty about being so honest.",
"Spouse: I decided to order the drink I was originally going to get, even though I had consumed 2 whole boba drinks already. Sugar overload!",
"Brother: I hope you left him a fat tip for his troubles.",
"Spouse: Yes, I tipped, [Player] made sure of that.",
"Spouse: With all the caffeine and sugar, I couldn't sleep all night. My heart was in trepidation even through the next morning.",
"Spouse: I probably wouldn't do that again.",
"Grandma: This sounds like the place I should try my first boba.",
"Spouse: I don't think I could boba for at least a month I'm so burnt out.",
"Brother: It is settled, right after this meal we're all going out for boba.",
"Spouse: Hah, no.",
"Brother: No, seriously.",
"Spouse: And seriously. No"],

"Grandma: You guys have it lucky. Where I grew up we had bread lines.",
"Grandma: My family would stand in a bread line for over six hours with the POSSIBILITY of receiving a loaf of bread.",
"Grandma: I remember one particular occasion where my mom told me to take my baby sister with me and go stand in the bread line.",
"Grandma: I was only 8 years old, and my baby sister was less than a year.",
"Grandma: Standing is a whole day affair. Some people brought laundry. Others did their crafts in line.",
"Grandma: My sister and I stood in that line together for over eight hours until we finally reached the front.",
"Grandma: When we got there. The man with the bread said, 'One loaf of Bread.'",
"Grandma: I held my baby sister outstretched and said 'Two.'",
"Grandma: The bread man responded. 'Baby doesn't count. One loaf of bread.' We were then pushed out of line with our one loaf.",
"Mom: Jesus, that sounds horrible.",
"Grandma: It was, but it was also necessary. Though when I hear people complaining how they are tired of waiting, I like to retell that story.",

"Father talks about the virtues of Automated Cars":
["Mom: Roger, tell everyone about your automated cars meeting.",
"Dad: It wasn't a meeting, it was closer to a seminar.",

"Dad: So we are required to spend these credits every year on our choice of relevant education events.",
"Spouse: That's cool. What kind of choices for educational events are there?",
"Dad: As one example, employees can go to a local college or high school and present about their work at the company.",
"Dad: Other options are to attend talks about various topics, such as aerospace engineering, materials science, manager relations, customer relations, etc.",
"Dad: I decided to spend my credits on a five person panel from the various automotive manufacturers about the future of automated vehicles.",
"Dad: Disappointingly, the panel never went in-depth about the technology side of automated cars.",
"Dad: The panel just already affirmed what I already knew. Self-driving cars are coming.",
"Grandpa: Why would you want a self-driving car anyways? Driving is fun!",
"Grandpa: I remember driving my old station wagon across country to California. Now that was a trip to remember.",
"Grandpa: The sun was beating down, and we didn't have air conditioning in the car, so you rolled down the window and enjoyed the breeze.",
"Grandpa: Nowadays, you are spoiled with automatic windows, automatic car washers, automatic transmission.",
"Grandpa: Why even call it a car? Sounds to me more like a train you ride.",
"Dad: Yes Dad, which was the general gist of the whole thing. Some people like to drive their car.",
"Dad: Though one panelist seemed confident that it will eventually take over.",
"Dad: They quoted 48 minutes as the average amount of time a driver spends in their car per day.",
"Dad: If most of that time is spent in traffic, or just getting somewhere, then people will adopt a car that can do the nitty gritty driving.",
"Dad: Drivers can then spend their five leisure minutes on the beach boulevard cruising with manual control.",
"Grandpa: Enjoy your fandangled self-driving cars, if they ever come.",
"Grandpa: In the 1960s they used to say we'd have flying cars in the 2000s, but you don't see that now.",
"Brother: Maybe in my generation. First the self-driving cars, then the flying ones.",
"Cat: Meow (and then the world!)"],

"Brother recounts a hockey game he saw recently, and his friend has to go to the hospital":
["Brother: Yo, I watched a hockey game recently. There were cheap group tickets, so a bunch of my friends jumped on it to watch the game.",
"Spouse: Who was playing?",
"Brother: Some minor league team, the 'Raging Tornados', I believe?  It isn't important. The point is seeing two teams pummel each other over a little puck.",
"Grandpa: Yes, exactly!",
"Spouse: I suppose since we're glorifying the violence of the sport, were there any fights?",
"Brother: Ah hell yeah! The gloves were thrown to the ice, and the two players starting man-hugging each other.",
"Brother: The refs just let it go. There was no blood, but it was the intention that mattered.",
"Brother: Sadly, it isn't like some video games where the winner of the fight gets to stay on the ice. The perpetrator in this case got the penalty.",
"Brother: But anyways, what was cool was we were allowed to play some broomball on the ice before the game due to our group size.",
"Brother: That was loads of fun. Until someone got injured.",
"Mom: Heavens no!",
"Brother: Well, it wasn't from the broomball.",
"Brother: Later, when our group was walking around, waiting for the actual game to start, the two hockey teams were practicing and a puck flew into the crowd.",
"Brother: It smacked one of my friends in the neck, and they had to go to the infirmary.",
"Mom: But were they okay?",

"Brother: The stadium was filled with 'awwws' when they approached the mics.",
"Brother: Well anyways, these girls were out near the mechanical bull before the game started.",
"Dad: The stadium has a mechanical bull?",
"Brother: Yup, pay your five dollars and take it for a ride. The operators know their clientele.",
"Brother: They let young kids 'tame the bull' while they throw the wrath of God down on the teenagers. Cause they know the teens want to flex their muscle.",
"Brother: I watched one teen tumble backwards over his head and shoulders in one bout.",
"Brother: The best part though was those little girls I mentioned earlier.",
"Brother: They surrounded the bull-riding-rink, all dressed in their school outfits.",

"Mom: But reading is fundamental. We can't let our students forget what they learned.",
"Spouse: It isn't that bad, 'The BFG' is a fun and entertaining book.",
"Brother: Granted, but forcing one to read kills their love of reading. It did for me.",
"Brother: After I began reading for fun rather than the school forcing me to do it, I could really appreciate the work for what they are.",

"Brother: Like, I know some American names, like Mark, are biblical in nature.",
"Grandma: Ahh, well yes. Very similar",
"Grandma: Lana is short for Svetlana, which was my given name. I shortened it to 'Lana' because it was easier to pronounce in those parts.",
