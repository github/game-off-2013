/** AI for following paths.
 * This AI is the default movement script which comes with the A* Pathfinding Project.
 * It is in no way required by the rest of the system, so feel free to write your own. But I hope this script will make it easier
 * to set up movement for the characters in your game. This script is not written for high performance, so I do not recommend using it for large groups of units.
 * \n
 * \n
 * This script will try to follow a target transform, in regular intervals, the path to that target will be recalculated.
 * It will on FixedUpdate try to move towards the next point in the path.
 * However it will only move in the forward direction, but it will rotate around it's Y-axis
 * to make it reach the target.
 * 
 * \section variables Quick overview of the variables
 * In the inspector in Unity, you will see a bunch of variables. You can view detailed information further down, but here's a quick overview.\n
 * The #repathRate determines how often it will search for new paths, if you have fast moving targets, you might want to set it to a lower value.\n
 * The #target variable is where the AI will try to move, it can be a point on the ground where the player has clicked in an RTS for example.
 * Or it can be the player object in a zombie game.\n
 * The speed is self-explanatory, so is turningSpeed, however #slowdownDistance might require some explanation.
 * It is the approximate distance from the target where the AI will start to slow down. Note that this doesn't only affect the end point of the path
 * but also any intermediate points, so be sure to set #forwardLook and #pickNextWaypointDist to a higher value than this.\n
 * #pickNextWaypointDist is simply determines within what range it will switch to target the next waypoint in the path.\n
 * #forwardLook will try to calculate an interpolated target point on the current segment in the path so that it has a distance of #forwardLook from the AI\n
 * Below is an image illustrating several variables as well as some internal ones, but which are relevant for understanding how it works.
 * Note that the #forwardLook range will not match up exactly with the target point practically, even though that's the goal.
 * \shadowimage{aipath_variables.png}
 * This script has many movement fallbacks.
 * If it finds a NavmeshController, it will use that, otherwise it will look for a character controller, then for a rigidbody and if it hasn't been able to find any
 * it will use Transform.Translate which is guaranteed to always work.
